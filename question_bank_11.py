                'explanation': '''Let's solve this step by step:

1. Maximum height calculation:
   - Initial velocity (u) = 19.6 m/s
   - Using v² = u² + 2gh where v = 0 at max height
   - 0 = (19.6)² + 2(-9.8)h₁
   - h₁ = 19.6 meters above the building
   - Total height = 25 + 19.6 = 44.6m

2. Time to reach ground:
   - Using h = ut + (1/2)gt²
   - -25 = 19.6t - 4.9t²
   - Solving quadratic equation: t = 3.27s

3. Final velocity:
   - Using v = u + gt
   - v = 19.6 + (-9.8)(3.27)
   - v = 32.1 m/s'''

T = 2π√(m/k)

This formula shows that:
1. The period is directly proportional to the square root of the mass

1. The girls were:

   - Actually quite conscious of being photographed
   - Making an effort to look casual

   - It captures a universal human moment
   - Shows the artifice involved in photography
   - Adds to the nostalgic tone of the poem'''
