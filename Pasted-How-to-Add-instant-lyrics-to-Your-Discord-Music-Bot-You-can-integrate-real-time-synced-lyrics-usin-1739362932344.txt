üõ† Steps to Implement /instant_lyrics

1Ô∏è‚É£ Fetch Song Lyrics using Genius API

Since you're already using the Genius API, get the song lyrics:

Example Code (Fetch Lyrics from Genius)

import requests

GENIUS_API_KEY = "YOUR_GENIUS_API_KEY"

def get_lyrics(song_name):
    headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {GENIUS_API_KEY}"}
    search_url = f"https://api.genius.com/search?q={song_name}"
    
    response = requests.get(search_url, headers=headers)
    data = response.json()
    
    if data["response"]["hits"]:
        song_url = data["response"]["hits"][0]["result"]["url"]
        return f"Lyrics found! Click here: {song_url}"
    else:
        return "Lyrics not found!"

2Ô∏è‚É£ Sync Lyrics with Music Player

Your music bot is already playing songs, so you need to sync the lyrics with the song‚Äôs timestamp.

Get the current timestamp from the song.

Fetch the corresponding lyrics line.

Send updates every few seconds in Discord.


Example Code (Sync with Music Player)

import asyncio

async def send_lyrics(ctx, song_name):
    lyrics = get_lyrics(song_name)
    
    if "Lyrics found!" in lyrics:
        await ctx.send(lyrics)  # Send Genius lyrics link
        return
    
    lyrics_lines = lyrics.split("\n")  # Split lyrics line by line
    
    for line in lyrics_lines:
        await ctx.send(f"üé§ {line}")  # Send one line at a time
        await asyncio.sleep(5)  # Adjust timing based on the song

3Ô∏è‚É£ Create the /instant_lyrics Command

Add this to your bot‚Äôs command handler (assuming you're using discord.py).

import discord
from discord.ext import commands

bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix="!")

@bot.command()
async def instant_lyrics(ctx):
    # Get current playing song (replace this with your music bot logic)
    current_song = "Shape of You"  # Example: Get it from your player
    
    await send_lyrics(ctx, current_song)

bot.run("YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN")
