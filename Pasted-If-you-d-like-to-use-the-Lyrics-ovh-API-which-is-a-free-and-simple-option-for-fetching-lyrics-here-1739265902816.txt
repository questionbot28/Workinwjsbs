If you'd like to use the Lyrics.ovh API, which is a free and simple option for fetching lyrics, here‚Äôs a guide to integrate it into your bot.

Step 1: No API Key Needed

The great thing about Lyrics.ovh is that you don‚Äôt need an API key to use it. You can directly make requests to the API.

Step 2: Install requests Library

You‚Äôll need the requests library to make HTTP requests to Lyrics.ovh. If you haven‚Äôt already, install it:

pip install requests

Step 3: Create a Command to Fetch Lyrics

Now, let's create a simple command where your bot will fetch lyrics for a given song.

Code Example:

import requests
import discord
from discord.ext import commands

bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix="!")

@bot.command()
async def lyrics(ctx, *, song_name):
    await ctx.send("üîç Searching for lyrics...")

    # URL for Lyrics.ovh API
    url = f"https://lyricsovh.xyz/v1/{song_name}"

    try:
        # Send request to Lyrics.ovh
        response = requests.get(url)

        # Check if the response is successful
        if response.status_code == 200:
            data = response.json()

            if 'lyrics' in data:
                lyrics = data['lyrics']
                lyrics = lyrics[:2000]  # Limit to 2000 characters (Discord limit)
                embed = discord.Embed(title=f"üé§ Lyrics for {song_name}", description=lyrics, color=discord.Color.blue())
                embed.set_footer(text="Powered by Lyrics.ovh")
                await ctx.send(embed=embed)
            else:
                await ctx.send("‚ùå Lyrics not found.")
        else:
            await ctx.send("‚ùå Error fetching lyrics.")

    except Exception as e:
        await ctx.send(f"‚ùå An error occurred: {e}")

Explanation of Code:

1. Song Name: The user provides a song name (e.g., !lyrics Shape of You).


2. Request Lyrics: The bot sends a request to the Lyrics.ovh API with the song name.


3. Response Handling: If the response contains the lyrics, the bot will send them to Discord. If the song is not found, it will notify the user.


4. Character Limit: The bot will send up to 2000 characters of lyrics to avoid truncation by Discord‚Äôs message size limit.



Step 4: Running the Bot

1. Run the bot and use the !lyrics <song_name> command in your Discord server to search for the lyrics of a song.

Example: !lyrics Shape of You


2. The bot will reply with the lyrics if found, or an error message if the song is not available.



Step 5: Testing

Test with a few songs to check if everything works properly. Keep in mind that Lyrics.ovh may not have every song, as its database is smaller than other services like Musixmatch.

Optional Enhancements:

Error Handling: Handle any specific errors or edge cases such as songs with special characters or songs that don‚Äôt exist in the database.

Search Suggestions: You could also add a feature where the bot suggests songs if no exact match is found.


This should be a good start to fetch lyrics using Lyrics.ovh. Let me know if you need more help!
