Do these all If the API connection test is successful but your bot still can’t fetch lyrics, then the issue might be in how the bot processes the Genius API response.

Next Steps to Debug

✅ 1. Check If Lyrics Exist for the Song

Try running this script manually to fetch the lyrics and see what Genius API returns:

import os
import requests

GENIUS_API_KEY = os.getenv("GENIUS_API_KEY")
headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {GENIUS_API_KEY}"}
search_url = "https://api.genius.com/search?q=Shape%20of%20You%20Ed%20Sheeran"

response = requests.get(search_url, headers=headers)

if response.status_code == 200:
    data = response.json()
    print("Search Results:", data)
else:
    print("Error:", response.status_code, response.text)

If the response contains no results, Genius might not be recognizing the query correctly.

If it returns a valid URL to the song, but your bot still fails, then the problem is in your bot’s lyrics extraction logic.

✅ 2. Check If the Bot Extracts the Lyrics Correctly

If the API returns a song but your bot says "No lyrics found", the issue might be how your bot fetches lyrics from the song page.

Try manually getting lyrics with:

song_url = "https://genius.com/Ed-sheeran-shape-of-you-lyrics"
lyrics_response = requests.get(song_url, headers=headers)
print(lyrics_response.text)

If this returns HTML instead of lyrics, your bot might be missing the correct lyrics extraction method.

✅ 3. Check for Errors in the Bot Logs

Your screenshot shows:

ERROR - Error getting lyrics: 'Coroutine' object has no attribute 'strip'

This means your bot is treating an async function as a normal function.

Try adding await before calling any async functions in your lyrics command:

lyrics = await get_lyrics(song_url)
lyrics = lyrics.strip()  # Now it should work

Final Fixes

1️⃣ Run the API test script to confirm Genius returns search results.
2️⃣ If the bot finds a song but not the lyrics, fix the lyrics extraction.
3️⃣ If you see a 'Coroutine' object has no attribute 'strip' error, add await before async functions.
