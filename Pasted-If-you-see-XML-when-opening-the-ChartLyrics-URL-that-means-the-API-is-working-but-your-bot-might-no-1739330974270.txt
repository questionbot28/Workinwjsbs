If you see XML when opening the ChartLyrics URL, that means the API is working but your bot might not be handling the response correctly. Let's debug and fix it.

‚úÖ Step 1: Check If Lyrics Are Found

Modify your bot‚Äôs code to log the API response and check if it's actually finding lyrics:

import aiohttp
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET
import discord
from discord.ext import commands

bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix="!", intents=discord.Intents.default())

async def get_lyrics(song_name):
    url = f"http://api.chartlyrics.com/apiv1.asmx/SearchLyricText?lyricText={song_name}"

    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        async with session.get(url) as response:
            if response.status != 200:
                return "‚ùå Lyrics feature is currently unavailable."

            data = await response.text()
            root = ET.fromstring(data)

            # DEBUG: Print the raw XML response (check Replit console)
            print("API Response:", data)

            first_result = root.find("SearchLyricResult")
            if first_result is None:
                return "‚ùå No lyrics found. Try another song."

            song_title = first_result.find("Song").text or "Unknown Title"
            artist = first_result.find("Artist").text or "Unknown Artist"
            lyrics_url = first_result.find("LyricUrl").text

            return f"üéµ **{song_title}** by **{artist}**\nüîó [Full Lyrics Here]({lyrics_url})"

@bot.command()
async def lyrics(ctx, *, song_name):
    await ctx.send(f"üé∂ Searching for lyrics: **{song_name}**...")
    lyrics_result = await get_lyrics(song_name)
    await ctx.send(lyrics_result)

bot.run("your_discord_bot_token")

‚úÖ Step 2: Run the Bot & Check Console Logs

Run your bot and use the command:

!lyrics Shape of You

Look at the Replit console output for the "API Response:" message.

If no <SearchLyricResult> is in the XML, the API didn't find lyrics.

‚úÖ Step 3: Improve Error Handling

If the API returns an empty response, update the bot to handle this properly:

if not list(root):
    return "‚ùå ChartLyrics API is not returning lyrics for this song. Try another song."


---

üîπ What‚Äôs Next?

1. Run the bot and check if the API is returning lyrics.


2. If the API isn't returning lyrics, it might not have the song in its database.


3. If you want full lyrics, we need to scrape them (I can help with that).
