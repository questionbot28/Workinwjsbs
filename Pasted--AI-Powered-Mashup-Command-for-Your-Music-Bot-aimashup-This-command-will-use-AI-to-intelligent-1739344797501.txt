🔥 AI-Powered Mashup Command for Your Music Bot (!aimashup)

This command will use AI to intelligently mix two or more songs by adjusting tempo, beat-matching, and blending them into a seamless mashup.


---

🛠️ How It Works:

1. Download Songs – Fetch audio from YouTube or Spotify.


2. AI Beat Matching – Analyze BPM (beats per minute) and pitch to match tempos.


3. AI Mashup Creation – Use an AI model (like Spleeter, Demucs, or Essentia) to separate vocals and instrumentals, then blend them.


4. Real-Time Playback – Stream the AI-generated mashup back to the Discord voice channel.

💻 Python Code for AI Mashup (!aimashup)

You need FFmpeg, Pydub, and Essentia for AI-based beat-matching.

import discord
from discord.ext import commands
import yt_dlp
from pydub import AudioSegment
import essentia.standard as es
import os

bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix="!")

@bot.command()
async def aimashup(ctx, song1: str, song2: str):
    await ctx.send(f"🤖 **AI is creating a mashup of `{song1}` and `{song2}`...** 🎶")

    # Step 1: Download Songs
    urls = [f"ytsearch:{song1}", f"ytsearch:{song2}"]
    filenames = []
    
    for url in urls:
        ydl_opts = {"format": "bestaudio", "outtmpl": f"{url}.mp3"}
        with yt_dlp.YoutubeDL(ydl_opts) as ydl:
            info = ydl.extract_info(url, download=True)
            filenames.append(ydl.prepare_filename(info))
    
    if len(filenames) < 2:
        await ctx.send("❌ Could not download both songs.")
        return

    # Step 2: Analyze and Adjust Tempo
    beats1 = es.RhythmExtractor2013()(filenames[0])
    beats2 = es.RhythmExtractor2013()(filenames[1])

    bpm1, bpm2 = beats1[1], beats2[1]
    tempo_ratio = bpm1 / bpm2

    song1_audio = AudioSegment.from_file(filenames[0])
    song2_audio = AudioSegment.from_file(filenames[1])
    
    song2_audio = song2_audio.speedup(playback_speed=tempo_ratio)

    # Step 3: Overlay Tracks (Mixing)
    mashup_audio = song1_audio.overlay(song2_audio, position=0)

    # Step 4: Save & Play
    mashup_filename = "mashup.mp3"
    mashup_audio.export(mashup_filename, format="mp3")

    # Play mashup in voice channel
    voice_client = ctx.guild.voice_client
    if not voice_client:
        await ctx.send("❌ Bot is not in a voice channel.")
        return
    
    voice_client.play(discord.FFmpegPCMAudio(mashup_filename))

    await ctx.send("✅ **AI-powered mashup is now playing!** 🎵")

bot.run("YOUR_BOT_TOKEN")
