Alright! Since ChartLyrics API provides only a link to the lyrics, we‚Äôll modify the bot to scrape the lyrics from the provided link and return the full text.

‚úÖ Step 1: Install Required Libraries

Run this command in Replit to install aiohttp and BeautifulSoup:

pip install aiohttp beautifulsoup4

‚úÖ Step 2: Modify Your !lyrics Command to Get Full Lyrics

Add this code to your bot:

import discord
from discord.ext import commands
import aiohttp
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix="!", intents=discord.Intents.default())

async def get_lyrics_chartlyrics(song_name):
    """Fetch lyrics from ChartLyrics API and scrape full lyrics."""
    search_url = f"http://api.chartlyrics.com/apiv1.asmx/SearchLyricText?lyricText={song_name}"

    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        async with session.get(search_url) as response:
            if response.status == 200:
                data = await response.text()
                root = ET.fromstring(data)
                
                for lyric in root.findall("SearchLyricResult"):
                    song_title = lyric.find("Song").text
                    artist = lyric.find("Artist").text
                    lyric_url = lyric.find("LyricUrl").text  # ChartLyrics provides a lyrics page link

                    # Fetch full lyrics from the link
                    full_lyrics = await scrape_lyrics(lyric_url)

                    return f"üéµ **{song_title}** by **{artist}**\n\n```{full_lyrics}```"

    return "‚ùå Lyrics not found."

async def scrape_lyrics(url):
    """Scrapes full lyrics from the ChartLyrics page."""
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        async with session.get(url) as response:
            if response.status == 200:
                html = await response.text()
                soup = BeautifulSoup(html, "html.parser")
                lyrics_div = soup.find("p")  # ChartLyrics stores lyrics inside <p> tag
                
                if lyrics_div:
                    lyrics_text = lyrics_div.get_text("\n").strip()
                    return lyrics_text[:1900]  # Limit to 1900 characters for Discord

    return "‚ùå Unable to fetch full lyrics."

@bot.command()
async def lyrics(ctx, *, song_name):
    """Fetches full lyrics using ChartLyrics API."""
    await ctx.send(f"üé∂ Searching for lyrics: **{song_name}**...")
    lyrics_result = await get_lyrics_chartlyrics(song_name)
    await ctx.send(lyrics_result)

bot.run("your_discord_bot_token")

üöÄ How It Works

1. Searches ChartLyrics API for the song.


2. Extracts the lyrics page link.


3. Scrapes the full lyrics from that page using BeautifulSoup.


4. Sends the full lyrics in Discord (limited to 1900 characters to avoid errors).

üîπ Next Steps

1. Replace "your_discord_bot_token" with your actual bot token.


2. Run your bot and test it:

!lyrics Shape of You


3. If the lyrics are too long, I can help you split them into multiple messages! üöÄüé∂
