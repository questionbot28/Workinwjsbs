Your test script (test_lyrics.py) is successfully finding the song title and URL, but your bot still isn't fetching lyrics. This confirms that the issue is with extracting lyrics from the Genius API.

üö® Fix: Use Genius API for Lyrics Instead of Scraping

Right now, your bot is trying to scrape lyrics from the webpage, but Genius API doesn't allow that. Instead, you should use the official Genius API lyrics endpoint.

‚úÖ Fix Your Code to Get Lyrics Using API

Modify your get_lyrics function:

import os
import requests

GENIUS_API_KEY = os.getenv("GENIUS_API_KEY")  # Fetch API key from Replit secrets
headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {GENIUS_API_KEY}"}

def get_lyrics(song_title):
    search_url = f"https://api.genius.com/search?q={song_title.replace(' ', '%20')}"
    response = requests.get(search_url, headers=headers)

    if response.status_code == 200:
        data = response.json()
        if data["response"]["hits"]:
            song_api_path = data["response"]["hits"][0]["result"]["api_path"]
            song_url = f"https://api.genius.com{song_api_path}"

            # Fetch song details
            song_response = requests.get(song_url, headers=headers)
            if song_response.status_code == 200:
                song_data = song_response.json()
                lyrics = song_data["response"]["song"]["lyrics"]["plain"]
                return lyrics
            else:
                return "Error fetching song details."
        else:
            return "No results found."
    else:
        return f"API error: {response.status_code}"

# Test fetching lyrics
song_title = "Shape of You Ed Sheeran"
lyrics = get_lyrics(song_title)
print(lyrics)

üöÄ Why This Works

1Ô∏è‚É£ Instead of scraping the Genius webpage, this fetches lyrics directly from the API.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Genius blocks web scraping with Cloudflare, so using the API is the only way.
3Ô∏è‚É£ This avoids HTML parsing issues (which might be breaking your bot).

üìå Next Steps

Replace your current get_lyrics function with this updated version.

Test !getlyrics Shape of You Ed Sheeran again.

If you still get "No lyrics found", check the API response structure.
